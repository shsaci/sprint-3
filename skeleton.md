What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?  
It turns into a mobile version of the site and makes a few changes to the regular design of the site.  
  The things I noticed most were the padding reduces once screen size reduces, the position of the 'phone' image becomes relative as opposed to absolute, and the double phone-image feature which is otherwise visible on larger screen dissapears.  

  The columns stack on top of each other once svcreen size is less than 550px as opposed to being visible next to each other, which is what it does on larger screens.
